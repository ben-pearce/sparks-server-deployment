# ðŸ¤– Development Server Deployment

This repository contains my Docker Compose files and configuration files for services hosted on my development workstation/server. The goal is to create a remote development environment accessible via a thin client from anywhere, leveraging additional computing power and eliminating the need to maintain multiple instances of my environments.

## Containers

{containers}

## Prerequisites

A linux-based operating system with [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.

## Configuration
The `.env` file stores environment variables to make starting the containers easy. This should be modified to match your needs before starting the containers for the first time.

## Contributions

First of all, **thanks for your interest!** But due to this being a personal project of mine tailored to my own needs, I cannot accept pull requests on this repository. Please feel free to fork and tweak this project though.
