# ðŸ¤– Development Server Deployment

This repository contains my Docker Compose files and configuration files for services hosted on my development workstation/server. The goal is to create a remote development environment accessible via a thin client from anywhere, leveraging additional computing power and eliminating the need to maintain multiple instances of my environments.

## Prerequisites

A linux-based operating system with [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.

## Configuration
The `.env` file stores environment variables to make starting the containers easy. This should be modified to match your needs before starting the containers for the first time.

| `SMTP_USER` | SMTP username. | `postmaster@example.com` |
| `TZ` | Timezone for all containers. | `Europe/London` |
| `PUID` | System user ID to run containers as. | `1000` |
