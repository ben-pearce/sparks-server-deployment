# ðŸ¤– Development Server Deployment

This repository contains my Docker Compose files and configuration files for services hosted on my development workstation/server. The goal is to create a remote development environment accessible via a thin client from anywhere, leveraging additional computing power and eliminating the need to maintain multiple instances of my environments.

## Containers

| **Name** | **Description** | **Ports** | **Links** |
|---|---|---|---|
| [code-server](./stacks/docker-compose.code.yml#L3)  | VS Code in the browser |  | [GitHub](https://github.com/coder/code-server) |
| [sparks-github-runner](./stacks/docker-compose.github.yml#L3)  |  |  |  |
| [syncthing](./stacks/docker-compose.syncthing.yml#L3)  | Free and open source peer-to-peer file synchronization | `22000:22000/tcp`, `22000:22000/udp`, `21027:21027/udp` |  |



## Prerequisites

A linux-based operating system with [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.

## Configuration
The `.env` file stores environment variables to make starting the containers easy. This should be modified to match your needs before starting the containers for the first time.

| `HOST` | The main host for web-based services. | `example.com` |
| `SMTP_HOST` | SMTP mail server host. | `mail.example.com` |
| `SMTP_USER` | SMTP username. | `postmaster@example.com` |
| `TZ` | Timezone for all containers. | `Europe/London` |
| `PUID` | System user ID to run containers as. | `1000` |
| `PGID` | System group ID to run containers as. | `1000` |
| `CONFIG_DIR` | Location of config storage on host. | `.config` |
| `DATA_DIR` | Location of data storage on host. | `.data` |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | Administrative email address. | `somebody@email.com` |
| `HOME_DIR` | Home directory for user. | `/home/user` |
